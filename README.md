## File Structure

### **Frontend Components**
- **`src/app`**: Defines the global layout, styles, and metadata.
- **`src/components`**:
  - **`InvoiceForm`**: Collects user input with client-side validation.
  -  **`InvoicePreview`**: Displays the invoice PDF after requesting, calls on `InvoiceTemplate`

  - **`src/components/invoice`**: Components for generating the invoice, such as subcomponents including `InvoiceTemplate`, `InvoiceHeader`, `InvoiceSummary`, `InvoiceDetails`, and more.
    - **`InvoiceTemplate`**: Combines multiple invoice sections into a cohesive PDF document.


### **Services**
- **`src/services/api.ts`**: Manages API requests to fetch listing details from Garageâ€™s backend.
- **`src/services/api.test.ts`**: Contains Jest unit tests for API interactions.

### **Types**
- **`src/types/ListingResponseData.ts`**: Defines the structure of API response data.
- **`src/types/InvoiceProps.ts`**: Provides detailed types for invoice-related props, ensuring consistency across components.

### **Utilities**
- **`src/utils/mapListingToInvoiceSections.ts`**: Maps API response data to structured invoice sections for rendering.

## Thought Process

### Code Decisions
1. **TypeScript Usage**:
   - Employed TypeScript for robust type safety, ensuring reliable and predictable API interactions.
   - Defined specific types (e.g., `ListingResponseData`, `InvoiceProps`) to reduce ambiguity and streamline development.

2. **Validation**:
   - Implemented email and URL validation in `InvoiceForm` using regex patterns.
   - Provided user-friendly error messages to improve the formâ€™s usability.

3. **PDF Generation**:
   - Used `@react-pdf/renderer` for modular and customizable invoice creation.
   - Designed the `InvoiceTemplate` component to orchestrate the layout using props mapped from API data.

### Design Decisions
1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Split invoice sections into individual components (e.g., `InvoiceHeader`, `InvoiceDetails`) for better reusability and maintainability.
   - Ensured that components follow single-responsibility principles, making future enhancements easier.

2. **Styling**:
   - Used TailwindCSS for responsive and visually appealing UI.
   - Applied consistent styles across components, leveraging CSS variables for theming.

3. **Preview Integration**:
   - Integrated a real-time preview using `@react-pdf/renderer` to enhance the user experience.

4. **API Interaction**:
   - Centralized API calls in `src/services/api.ts` to separate business logic from UI components.

### Notable Code Highlights
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Email validation ensures addresses conform to common formats.
   - URL validation restricts input to Garage listing URLs, reducing errors and invalid API calls.

2. **Mapping API Data**:
   - The `mapListingToInvoiceSections` utility cleanly transforms raw API data into structured props for invoice components.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Display meaningful error messages for failed API calls and invalid inputs.
   - Graceful fallback if no data is returned.

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Enhanced Invoice Formatting**:
   - Refactor the display of long descriptions to avoid clutter. Consider using two columns or other forms of display.

2. **Increase Speed**:
   - Increase efficiency of the app so that the PDFs can be generated faster, with less waiting for the preview.

3. **Email Functionality**:
   - Add an option to send invoices via email directly from the app.

4. **Dark Mode**:
   - Implement a dark mode toggle for improved accessibility.


### Long-Term Features
1. **Custom Notes**:
   - Allow users to add personalized notes or messages to the invoice.

2. **Expansion in Audiences**:
   - Support multiple languages and regional formats for broader usability.

3. **Tax Calculations**:
   - Add dynamic tax calculations based on user input or geographic data.
